Just a bit of fun with Advent of Code. This year I'm just having fun with the challenges, and trying to solve them in offbeat or silly ways. Previous years I've tried to make the code-golf-iest solution each day, but that was stress, and Flying Spaghetti Monster knows I don't need more stress in 2020. I may switch languages for funsies, but I will work primarily in Python, methinks.

Feel free to copy the code in this repository for whatever purposes you so desire, no credit necessary!
